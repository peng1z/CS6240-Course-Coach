            <h2>Course Overview</h2>
            <p>This platform is designed to help students access all the resources needed for the CS6240 course, 
                including video lectures, homework, and additional study materials.</p>
            
            <h2>How to Use</h2>
            <p>Navigate through the sections using the top menu to find homework guidance, video tutorials, and resources.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click on the "Homework" button.</li>
                <li>Search for videos using the search bar.</li>
                <li>Click on a video to open it in the browser.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2> How to Succeed in this Course</h2>
            <p>This is an advanced graduate course about a rapidly evolving topic. It is therefore essential that you go through 
                the online material carefully and methodically, attend the lectures (hybrid version) and participate in online 
                discussions. Homework is designed to help you understand the material and prepare for the exam. The following often works well:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>When going through the online material, make notes about questions you have or about material you find difficult to understand. 
                    Then share these questions through the online forum or in class (hybrid version).</li>
                <li>When you get a question in a check-your-knowledge quiz wrong or were not sure about the answer, go back to the corresponding 
                    online material and try to find the answer.</li>
                <li>After going through an online lecture, try to explain the material to yourself or to a friend. This way you can better judge if 
                    you understand it. Once you identified things that need clarification, try to find the answer yourself by consulting one or more of 
                    the recommended books. If you cannot find the answer with reasonable effort, ask others for help (online discussion forum, office 
                    hours, and in-class discussions).</li>
                <li>Start working on homework assignments as soon as they come out. This way you have time to ask questions and get help.</li>
            </ol>
